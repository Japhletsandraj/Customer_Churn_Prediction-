# Customer Churn Prediction & Price Sensitivity Analysis

##  Project Overview

An end-to-end machine learning solution that **identifies price sensitivity thresholds** and **predicts customer churn risk** through data-driven analysis of subscription businesses.

  **Key Discovery**: Found that customers paying **above $70/month** have **88% churn rate**, while those below **$63/month** show significantly higher retention.

##  Key Features

### Business Intelligence
- **Price Sensitivity Analysis**: Identified exact price breaking points causing churn
- **Contract Impact**: Month-to-month contracts showed **100% churn rate** vs 25% for annual contracts
- **Survivor Profiling**: Analyzed the 12% who stayed despite pricing issues

### Machine Learning Models
1. **Price Threshold Classifier** - Predicts if a price point will cause churn
2. **Survivor Profile Predictor** - Identifies customers likely to stay
3. **Risk Scoring Engine** - Combines multiple factors into actionable risk scores

###  Data Insights
- **88.3% overall churn rate** in analyzed dataset (business crisis scenario)
- **$13.32 price gap** between churners ($75.87) and survivors ($62.55)
- **30.3 months avg tenure** for survivors vs 17.5 months for churners

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

# Key analytical approach
- Statistical validation of price thresholds
- Cohort analysis by contract type
- Survival analysis of customer tenure
